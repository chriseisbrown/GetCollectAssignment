## GetCollectAssignment

The output is written to a file called assignment_results.csv.  This data is in csv format and has the following columns

[1]    activity_name
This can be:  
1.WALKING
2.WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3.WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4.SITTING
5.STANDING
6.LAYING

The values presented for each column are means of the measures that were collected, grouped by subject for each physical activity undertaken in the experiments. 

The following columns are standard deviation or mean measures extracted from the original data set.  These columns were chosen as the assignment was not specific about which columns to use, only those that were std or mean.
